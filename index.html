        <p>
            My name is Ilegubo Kofi Owusu. I am currently enrolled in a bachelor's degree programme in Software
            Engineering with which I hope to pursue a career in software engineering and cybersecurity.
            I have over a year of experience working with and providing technical assistance in computer related issues.
            My most recent employment was with city gate computer systems where I operated and maintained printing
            press, copiers,
            laminators and binders for high volume production and provided technical support for clients who faced
            issues with their
            computers. I love organizing digital files, trouble shooting and managing job setup. I know I can bring
            added efficiency
            to your organization.
